Quote:https://github.com/powermock/powermock
the powermock is a framework that extends other mock libraries such as EasyMock 
with more powerful capabilities. 
PowerMock uses a custom classloader and bytecode manipulation 
to enable mocking of static methods, constructors, final classes and methods, 
private methods, removal of static initializers and more. 
By using a custom classloader no changes need to be done to 
the IDE or continuous integration servers which simplifies adoption. 
Developers familiar with the supported mock frameworks will find PowerMock 
easy to use, since the entire expectation API is the same, 
both for static methods and constructors. PowerMock aims 
to extend the existing API's with a small number of methods 
and annotations to enable the extra features. 
Currently PowerMock supports EasyMock and Mockito.
